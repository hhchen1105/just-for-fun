* ``n-queens-brute-force.py``: a brute force solution to the N-queens puzzle

  Sample usage: ``python n-queens-brute-force.py -n 5``

  The argument ``-n`` specifies the height (and the width) of the board, which equals the number of queens to be placed on the board.

* ``n-queens-closed-form.py``: one closed form solution to the N-queens puzzle

  Sample usage: ``python n-queens-closed-form.py -n 5``

  The argument ``-n`` specifies the height (and the width) of the board, which equals the number of queens to be placed on the board.

  The closed form solution is based on Dr. Bo Bernhardsson's paper [1].
